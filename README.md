# vladsgeneralrepository

A collection of Kubernetes configurations, automation scripts, and various tools I've built and use in my projects.

## What's Here

For now, this repository contains:

- **Kubernetes deployments** - Various containerized applications and services
- **Automation scripts** - Tools for monitoring, data export, and system management
- **Configuration files** - Ready-to-use configs for different platforms and services

## Structure

Each folder contains its own README with specific setup instructions and documentation. Browse around to see what might be useful for your projects.

## Future Plans

This is a growing collection - who knows what I'll add next! Could be more container configs, additional automation tools, or entirely different types of projects.

## Usage

Each subfolder is self-contained with its own documentation. Check the individual README files for setup instructions and usage details.
